# asst3_SLE712
Code to support assignment 3 task for unit SLE712

# myscript.sh
myscript.sh is a script to incorporate mismatches with msbar into a sequence and preform a blast search.
Using the msbar the sequence was mutated by changing the mismatch count. 
For each mismatch count, 100 tests were performed by creating a loop and the performance of blast was assessed. 
The mismatch numbers were initially changed and assessed in a working directory which was later inserted to aat3_SLE712.
The change of mismatch count from 155 to 330 showed a gradual drop of blast performance.
